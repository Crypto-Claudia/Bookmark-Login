# Password Decryptor Bookmarklet

This repository contains a bookmarklet script designed to decrypt and autofill passwords on various websites. The bookmarklet prompts the user for a decryption phrase, decrypts the stored credentials, and populates the login fields on the current page.

## Features

- **Decryption**: Allows users to decrypt encrypted password data using a user-provided phrase.
- **Autofill**: Automatically fills in login credentials (username and password) into the appropriate fields on the page.
- **Customizable**: Modify the `messages` and `fieldMappings` objects in the script to fit your needs.

## Encryption Details

- **Encryption Algorithm**: AES-CBC (Advanced Encryption Standard in Cipher Block Chaining mode)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256
- **Key Length**: 256 bits
- **Initialization Vector (IV)**: 16 bytes

The encryption process involves deriving a key from the user-provided decryption phrase using PBKDF2, and then using that key to decrypt data encrypted with AES-CBC.

## Installation

1. **Create a Bookmarklet:**
   - Copy the entire JavaScript code from `bookmarklet.js`.
   - Create a new bookmark in your web browser.
   - Paste the JavaScript code into the bookmarkâ€™s URL field.
